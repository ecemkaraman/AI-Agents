## **🔹 Step 1: Understanding the AI Agent Framework**

### **What is an AI Agent?**

- An **autonomous entity** that perceives an environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve goals.
- **AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment**
- We call it Agent because it has *agency*, aka it has the ability to interact with the environment.

- AI agents can be **simple (rule-based)** or **complex (learning-based, adaptive, multi-agent systems).**

### **Core Properties of AI Agents:**

| **Property** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Autonomy** | Operates without direct human intervention. | Self-driving car |
| **Perception** | Gathers info from sensors/APIs/environment. | ChatGPT reads user input |
| **Decision-Making** | Selects optimal actions based on rules, utility, or learning. | Chess AI picking a move |
| **Learning** | Improves performance from past experiences. | AlphaGo learning from games |
| **Action Execution** | Performs a real-world task based on a decision. | AI trading bot executing orders |
