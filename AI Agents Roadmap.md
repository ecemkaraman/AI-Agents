    def respond(self, user_input):
        if self.state == "greeting":
            self.state = "ask_name"
            return "Hello! What's your name?"
        elif self.state == "ask_name":
            self.state = "done"
            return f"Nice to meet you, {user_input}!"
        else:
            return "I don't understand."

bot = ChatbotFSM()

            new_cost = cost[current] + 1

            if neighbor not in cost or new_cost < cost[neighbor]:
                cost[neighbor] = new_cost
