### **🌍 Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Intro**

---

## **1️⃣ What is NLP?**

💡 **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** → Field combining **linguistics** & **machine learning** to understand human language.

📌 **Goal** → Go beyond individual words & **understand context** in language.

---

## **2️⃣ Common NLP Tasks & Examples**

### **📌 Sentence-Level Tasks**

- **Sentiment analysis** → Classifying review sentiment
- **Spam detection** → Identifying spam emails
- **Grammar checking** → Detecting sentence correctness
- **Textual entailment** → Checking logical sentence relationships

### **📌 Word-Level Tasks**

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** → Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** → Extracting persons, locations, organizations

### **📌 Text Generation**

- **Auto-completion** → Predicting next words in a sentence
- **Fill-in-the-blanks** → Predicting missing words in a masked text

### **📌 Question Answering**

- Extracting answers from a given context

### **📌 Sentence Transformation**

- **Translation** → Converting text between languages
- **Summarization** → Condensing text while retaining key points

### **📌 Beyond Text**

- **Speech recognition** → Converting audio into text
- **Computer vision** → Generating image captions

## **3️⃣ Why is NLP Challenging?**

💡 **Humans vs. Machines**

- **Humans** → Instinctively understand meaning & context
- **Machines** → Require structured data processing to interpret text

📌 **Example:**

- We intuitively **compare** "I am hungry" vs. "I am sad" → Machines **struggle** without proper encoding

🔎 **Challenges in NLP:**

- **Context understanding** → Words have different meanings based on usage
- **Ambiguity** → Same phrase can mean different things
- **Data representation** → ML models require structured text representation
