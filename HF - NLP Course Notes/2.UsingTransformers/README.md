### **🤖 Using Transformers – A High-Level Overview**

---

## **1️⃣ Why Use 🤗 Transformers?**

💡 **Transformer models are massive** (millions to billions of parameters), making training & deployment complex.

📌 **Challenges:**

- **🚀 Rapid Growth** → New models released **daily**, each with unique implementations.
- **⚙️ Experimentation Difficulty** → Trying multiple models manually is time-consuming.

✅ **Solution: 🤗 Transformers Library** → **Unified API** for loading, training & saving models effortlessly.

---

## **2️⃣ Key Features of 🤗 Transformers**

✔️ **🔽 Ease of Use** → Load & run a **state-of-the-art model in 2 lines** of code.

✔️ **🔄 Flexibility** → Models are **PyTorch (`nn.Module`)** & **TensorFlow (`tf.keras.Model`)** compatible.

✔️ **🛠 Simplicity** → Code is self-contained → **Easier to read, modify & experiment with.**

📌 **Unlike other ML libraries** → Each model has **its own layers** → No complex shared modules.
